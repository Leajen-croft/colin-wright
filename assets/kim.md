As a close Family Friend to The Wright Family, I am still finding it very difficult to think believe Colin, Head of the Wright family, Smiling, Happy, Living life to the Full has Very Sadly passed away So suddenly, leaving his Loved ones so extremely bereft.

Please allow me to give my deepest thoughts and Condolences to All who were Close to him.

Being a very close friend of Nick Wright - 2nd youngest Son, it gave me over 20yrs to know Colin and What a caring, kind, Interesting man he was.
I will miss turning the corner of Nick's R.d and seeing Colin's yellow van and know I am going to be able to say Hi and catch up over a coffee, talking of his Travels and Adventures.

When I first met Colin, there was not a building with Scaffolding in Cromer without Colin Wrights name on it, Work "was" his middle name.

As most will know He was an excellent tradesman and again Lucky to know the Family I have so many memories of his skills, that he went on to pass to  Nick  his Son, Colin was so very Proud to see Nick Stepping into his boots in the way of Career, That was Always plain to see.

Although Colin never stopped working, he seemed to find a Perfect happy medium.
He was a Happy relaxed easy to chat to man with Many Friends.

Colin seemed to be living his retired Life in a much Admired way, Free. Happy.  
For this we should be Thankful.

There are the times Amy his Grand-daughter would like me to mention, Like when Grandad Colin had been fishing and the crab he brought For Nick & Denise's Tea, and how the girls Amy age 10yrs and Emily 6yrs sat in the lounge pinching their noses as they didn't like the smell, Colin Loved his fishing trips. Or the Story I told her yesterday about how a long time ago he had a cockerel outside his home / building site and he got fed up of the noise, so said to my son, If I kill it, would your mum cook it, and Yes I did!  
It was as Tough as old boots!!!

Colin leaves SO many memories with us, too many to share at once, but he was such a person, that he will Never ever be forgotten and My Heart goes out to his Son's who I know are Struggling to cope with his so sudden passing away, I am sending my Love and thought's to you.

My Sincere condolences.  
Kim Ryder
