Colin was 17 years old when I met him at Maycroft youth club,
Brinnington, in the 60s. I didn't realise at that time what an important
part of my life the Wright family would have become over the next three years;
so much so that, Mr and Mrs Wright, Janice and Lynn would feel like a second
family to me, always making me feel welcome and when Colin was in the navy
and away from home I would often stay over with them on the weekends.

To say Colin was a special person is an understatement and even in those early
days, I would often say to him,  I can't believe you were not born a gypsy as he
yearned to travel the world.

Colin had his first love (his motorbike) at that time and he used to say, how he
would love to have the basics in a back pack and just take off on his bike
travelling the world; what a blessing that when we were next to catch up 43
years later he was doing exactly that  (minus the motorbike, thank goodness:)
just airports blending into each other, often probably wondering, which country
am I in today; from that time on, I learnt more about the geography of the world
than I ever learned in school is there anywhere in the world Colin didn't visit????

How blessed I feel that one of his journeys took him across the world to
Fremantle, Western Australia where I was able to catch up for a few hours
and where the last 43 years just disappeared, it was just two people sharing
our lives after the 60s and some very wonderful memories of our teenage years.

The only thing missing for Colin when he was travelling, was his family, it was
evident that his family were so very precious to him, Liam, Nick, Chris, Michael
(who is always with him) Lynn and Janice and their families; there was no
mistaking how proud Colin felt when talking about you all and he said, if only
he could take you all with him to share his adventures it would be the ultimate
for him (of course he also said, more likely they think I'm crazy and wonder
why he would do what he does, never mind dragging them along for the ride;)
but he always looked forward to going home at the end of the day to be with his
sons and daughter in laws.

I knew all about Liam's Dragon Lizards and how proud he was that Liam's
education was so much more important than ours would have been all those years
ago; a pity the eggs didn't hatch Liam.

Colin spoke of the special time he had with Lynn when in New Zealand taking her
to see the movie Australia and how it was fantastic because its the longest time
he has known Lynn not to speak ha! This was said, of course with much affection
and his usual sense of humour; he also spoke of how he will be always be grateful
for Lynn being the hard task master when at the lowest times in his life after
losing Michael and thinking his strength had deserted him, Lynn and the rest
of the family gave him the strength he needed to pick himself up and get back
on with life.

Colin wrote of the time Lynn and he went on a trip together to Combria which
was very special to him and he said she was a joy to be with but that he
wouldn't tell her that ha! I am sure he did Lynn, but just in case not,
I have it in writing.

Colin also spoke of the very sad time of Janice losing her beloved husband and
how he returned home to be with her as he wouldn't want to be anywhere else.

To have the family bond you all have is the most precious thing we can have
and I know Colin will be with you all at this time bringing you all closely
together to say your farewells for now.

I share deeply in your heartache at this time while remembering Colin as the 
free spirit he always has been, safe in the knowledge that he will be sharing
his next adventures with Michael; being encouraged by his mum and dad and
likely dragging Janice's husband along for the ride:)

God bless you all, my thoughts are with you and goodbye for now to a very
special lifelong friend.
