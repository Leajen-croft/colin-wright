Dear Col

We are sure going to miss your visit to NZ [twizel] we already have a to do list for when you come back this summer.

We were so glad to take you with us on our 1st visit to MT Cook about 6yrs ago.
You had just bought your 1st Colin style campervan from Dunedin, no stopping you now. The van knew all the roads from here to Waikuku that lead down to the sea. No wonder it took so long to get back to Pete’s place.

We took you freedom camping in the high country Hurunui and lake Sumner district, that was something you could do in the UK you said the remoteness is amazing. We treasure our memories of you and your relaxed way. I claimed you as my brother after losing min in recent years, your relaxed way, no need to fuss on your arrival , easy to please and entertain, fishing / meals at the pub or our local club and a beer or two.

You loved to read up on the history of places you were visiting and I’m sure at times you knew more about the district than the locals. We would chat a lot about place names and origins most stemming back to Britain. Twizel is named after a beautiful old 1500ad bridge over the river till in north Northumberland.

You arrived this year end of January and came to visit 2 weeks later in Feb you were due to fly home to England April 21st so you planned to meet us in Oamaru to say cherrio. Yes Oamaru is by the sea, it was a damn cold day ,we had pea/pie/pud in the old town pub, had a good old chat as you do with a friend and had the take care hug and see you later this year, not knowing it would be our last. off you went in your red van with " on the road again " written on the back door. you are on another journey now col, gone from our sight but never our memories, gone from our touch but never our hearts, so long Col thanks for being our friend for 9 years

dammit we will miss you " Pam / Jim   NZ

Deepest sympathy to all friends and families.
