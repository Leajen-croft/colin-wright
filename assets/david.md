Hello,

Colin was very funny and was always helpful to us two no matter the time or place. We own a business in paving in NZ and he always gave good points, advice and encouraged us on things we were unsure about, he had a lot of faith and always sharing his knowledge on his experiences with paving or stonework etc; we had a lot in common.

We always had hours of conversations over a beer or two and even good old fish and chips. He helped us build our kit set shed from scratch and (Sabrina and Colin) agreed to ignore the part numbers stuck on the sides showing the left side is meant to be on the right side and vice versa - that's what made it a special one of a kind shed. Colin and Sabrina with a thousand shed pieces that had taken over the place both just stood and looked at it for a minute then went in and made a coffee before even attempting it.

Colin also encouraged us to do things we usually wouldn't do such as getting a batch and going sea fishing in Kaikoura; he loved that place. It was really cool and we will always remember Colin for these experiences. Kaikoura is Colin everytime we enter that town or speak of it. I remember the last words we spoke when he left that day back to uk. We said winding him up 'we're going to put you on facebook' and he replied swift 'no you bloody wont' laughing and it went for a bit with joking around. He was a cool dude, even our Labrador thought he was family.

He has been down every hill and road; to sea he goes.

thanks Sabrina and David from NZ
